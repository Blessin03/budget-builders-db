## Decisions

## Design Decisions

1. The data dictionary is the single source of truth for table structures and field definitions.
2. Naming conventions use camelCase for EVERYTHING.
3. Database table names are plural.
4. No new tables, features, or functional scope will be added.
5. This refactor focuses on clarity, consistency, and portfolio quality only.
